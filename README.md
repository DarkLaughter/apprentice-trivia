## Welcome to Labyrinth Walk

This is a Trivia App, made for my submission for the 2020 Tandem SE Apprentice Challenge.<br/>
This app is built in React JS, using hooks and a data.json file, provided by Tandem for the challenge.<br/>
This app also uses React Router and React Player, so be sure to install should you want to play with this app locally.

The theme for this app takes inpiration from the Jim Henson movie Labyrinth (1986).

Basics for this app include:

- Being able to view quiestions.
- Each Quiz is 10 questions(random) out of a possible 21 questions, which will not repeat during your quiz round.
- Questions are multiple choice, and can only have 1 choice selected for each.
- Once you submit an answer, the correct answer will be revealed.
- At the end of the quiz, you will see how many questions you got right.

Some addtional items

- QA is questions and answers, some of the questions are specific, so they are provided with the answers for your review.
- The Media option in the Navbar will provide some videos such as the Movie Trailer. To help familiarze anyone that does not recall or know the movie.

This App is also live for demo purposes using this link [Labyrinth Walk](https://labyrinthwalk.netlify.app/)<br/>
